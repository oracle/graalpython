 * <li>{@code array}
 * <li>{@code memoryview}

 * <li>interop objects that return true from {@link InteropLibrary#hasBufferElements(Object)}
 * </ul>
 * The acquired buffer object should be accessed using {@link PythonBufferAccessLibrary} and needs
 * to be released using {@link PythonBufferAccessLibrary#release(Object)} method when done.
