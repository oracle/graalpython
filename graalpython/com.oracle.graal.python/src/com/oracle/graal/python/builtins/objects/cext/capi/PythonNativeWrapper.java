     * Determines if the native wrapper should always be materialized in native memory.
     * <p>
     * Native wrappers are usually materialized lazily if they receive
     * {@link InteropLibrary#toNative(Object)}. Sometimes, e.g., when using LLVM runtime, this may
     * never happen if the pointer never floats into real native code or memory. However, some
     * native wrappers emulate data structures where it does not make sense to emulate them and it
     * is more efficient to just allocate the native memory and write data to it. Also, in some
     * cases it is just necessary to enable byte-wise access (e.g. when using {@code memcpy}).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Therefore, wrappers may return {@code true} and the appropriate <it>Python-to-native</it>
     * transition code will consider that and eagerly return the pointer object. If {@code true} is
     * returned, the wrapper must also implement {@link #getReplacement(InteropLibrary)} which
     * returns the pointer object. Furthermore, wrappers must use
     * {@link #registerReplacement(Object, boolean, InteropLibrary)} to register the allocated
     * native memory in order that the native pointer can be resolved to the managed wrapper in the
     * <it>native-to-Python</it> transition.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the wrapper should be materialized eagerly, {@code false} otherwise.
